# Simple-Expense-Tracker By Arye Oskotsky
I'm a student at SFSU working on my own personal project. This project is written in java utilizing a mysql database. I am also applying the model, view, controller
methodology to the way that my program is structured. The UI is built using Swing and JFreeChart.
